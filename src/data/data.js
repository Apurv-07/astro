Some Taurus people have fine voices and a talent for music, or they may be good at sculpture or woodwork. Others are practical and can be excellent accountants or bookkeepers.

    description: `The crab is used to describe this sign because it carries its own house with it. It will also move sideways instead of in a straight line, and although a crab cannot really hurt you with its claws, it can hang on very tightly to something it wants.

    A typical Cancer person is home-loving and fond of his family. At the same time he is often quite subtle in his behaviour and may approach people and situations indirectly if he cannot get what he wants by going straight forward.

    image: "Leo.jpeg",
    description: `The lion is called the King of the Beasts, and astrologers think that this animal is a good symbol to represent the kind of personality which seems to belong to most Leos. If you watch a lion you will see that he is always dignified, proud looking, and relaxed. He seems to know that he is king.

    Sometimes he also enjoys being lazy and lying around in the sun. All this means that if you are a Leo you probably need plenty of time and opportunity in your life to do the things you want, things that give you joy and allow you to express yourself in a pleasurable way. Leos always like to think big, and do not enjoy things which are too detailed, or too dull. They also like to lead, and don't like being ordered around.
    
    There is another thing which is important to a Leo, and that is love. Leo people need plenty of love and attention. They can feel hurt if they are ignored, or if someone else takes the credit for something they have done. They love to have an audience, and even a fairly shy, quiet Leo might secretly look to see if anyone is watching when he is doing something.
    
    Leo is a fire sign, like Aries and Sagittarius. If you are a Leo, think about how good it feels to create something which is uniquely yours, something artistic or something exciting like a new invention, which everyone admires and which also brings pleasure to other people. Don't be afraid to ask for the attention and love you need, but remember that other people like to be loved and admired in return.`,

    description: `The symbol of Virgo the Maiden was chosen by astrologers to represent people born under this sign because there is a cool, clear quality to the way that a typical Virgo person thinks.

    Virgo people are usually very gentle and quiet, and love small animals and growing things. Many Virgos love to do detailed things and are talented at crafts like dressmaking. They will work hard to create something which is beautiful and useful at the same time.

    description: `When you use a pair of scales you must get exactly the right amount on each side to make them balance. If there is too much on one side, or too little on the other, the scales will tip. Astrologers think this is a good symbol for Libra people because they seem to need equal amounts of everything in their lives to be happy.

    Libra people need to keep a balance between work and play, and between their thoughts and their emotions. Sometimes they seem to have trouble making decisions, but this is because they must consider all sides of a question first. They are always striving for perfection and balance, and love beauty and harmony around them.
    
    The most important thing for a Libra person is this idea of harmony. Libra people love to have people about them and to feel that they are appreciated. They usually get very interested in the opposite sex early in life, because they need love and companionship. Lots of Libra people are artistic and appreciate beautiful things. Sometimes they are talented at music or singing, and often dress well. But they may also be good at mathematics and science, because there is a clear, logical quality to the way they think. Usually Libra people are well liked because they are charming and easy to get along with. When a Libra person argues or behaves badly, it is usually because he feels that something is unfair.
    
    Libra is an air sign, like Gemini and Aquarius. If you are a Libra, think about how good you feel when everything in your life seems to be harmonious and well-balanced, and when you have friends to go places or do things with.`,

At the same time, they do not like to be taken advantage of or injured, and many Scorpio people have a very strong sense of justice. This can make life difficult for Scorpio children if they think they are being unfairly punished. Scorpio children are often much wiser and more understanding than other children, so they should always be given reasons when they are told to do something.
    
    Many Scorpio people are good at things which require deep thought and understanding, like psychology. Some of them become fine doctors and surgeons, because they are interested in the mysteries of life and like to heal.

They often have a private inner world which is a very special and precious place to them, but they can be deeply compassionate towards other people who are unhappy.
